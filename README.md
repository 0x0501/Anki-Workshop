### Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have:

* **Bun**: The all-in-one JavaScript runtime. If you don't have it, install it from [bun.sh](https://bun.sh/).

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-repo/anki-workshop.git
    cd anki-workshop
    ```

2. **Install dependencies**:

    ```bash
    bun install
    ```

### Environment Setup

Create a `.env` file in the root of your project based on `wrangler.example.toml` and `sample-env`. You'll need to configure your database and authentication secrets here.

```env
# Example .env content (adjust as per your actual needs)
DATABASE_URL="d1://..."
AUTH_SECRET="your_super_secret_key"
```

## üßë‚Äçüíª Developing: Let's Build Something Awesome

Once you've set up your environment, starting the development server is a piece of cake:

```bash
bun run dev
```

This will launch the application in development mode, usually accessible at `http://localhost:5173`. Happy coding!

## üì¶ Building & Deploying: Share Your Masterpiece

To create a production-ready version of your app:

```bash
bun run build
```

For deployment, Anki Workshop leverages SvelteKit's adapter system. You may need to install an [adapter](https://svelte.dev/docs/kit/adapters) specific to your target environment (e.g., Cloudflare Pages, Vercel, Netlify).
